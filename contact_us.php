<p class="p1">FAQ</p>
<p class="p2"><br>Who are our Alumni?</p>
<p class="p3">College Of Engineering Vadakara alumni association is followed by students who they passout from various courses like Diploma , Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>How do I become a member of the CEV Alumni?</p>
<p class="p3">All undergraduates, diploma and post graduates of students can register as
 our alumni. It is important for alumni to update their particulars for the CEV Alumni
  Directory (Database) by register as a member online and pay at the counter of Alumni 
  CEV so that we can keep in touch with you for life.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>As an alumni, how can I contribute towards the College?</p>
<p class="p3">You can help by participating in the various activities organized by 
the College or by contributing ideas or programmes towards enriching learning 
experience of all students. Other assistance include donation, sponsorship and expert class. Whatever your contribution they are most welcome.</p>
<p class="p2"><br>I am still a student of the College, can I take part in alumni 
activities?</p>
<p class="p3">Yes, of course. We believed that the bond between alumni and students
 should begin as soon as the student enters the College because you will become
  our future alumni later on. The Alumni Advancement is also committed in organising 
  training especially in soft skills and career development programmes to raise your
   employability in the job market upon graduation. We hope this will instill a pride 
   in your alma mater and later on may wish to make whatever contribution towards 
   achieving excellence for the College.
